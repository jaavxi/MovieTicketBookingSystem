### About System
*In order to make a program possible, we use a stream of class and file handling in the C++ programming language. Two classes, class ticket and the class amount can be found in this project in which class ticket is inherited from the class amount. The project is simple to understand, and the source code has been presented in an understandable manner. We use DevC++ as an IDE for better code compilation & debugging as it is the modern and standard editor. Also, this mini project is easy to operate and understand by the users.*
